# Hooks

Custom React hooks for shared logic across components.

## Examples

- `useAuth`: Authentication state and methods
- `useRagQuery`: RAG query functionality
- `useSupabase`: Supabase client access
- `useVideoPlayer`: Video player controls

## Guidelines

- Follow React hooks naming convention (use prefix)
- Keep hooks focused and single-purpose
- Include proper TypeScript types
- Add JSDoc comments for documentation
